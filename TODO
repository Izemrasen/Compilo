Compiler
	Bug w/ "++" && "--" (var to be inc/dec is overwritten)
		I think it's because there's st_set_pos-- somewhere (we assure we are on top of stack but nooo)
	Debug pointers
	Sugar assignment
	Expressions
		Add "&ID"
	Cleaning
		Clean symtable.*
		st_get: instead of using yyerror() each time, put error handling in symtable.c
		free symbols whenever possible
	Find name for compiler
		Ideas: CompOte
	Test "for"
	Make use of "initialized" flag (error etc.)
Interpreter
	Feature for parsing ASM && saving it into a binary
		=> argument => better way of handling arguments (arg parser)
Architecture
	Implement instructions: LOADI, STOREI

BUGS
	#1. If/else: when multiple "if" in "else", "if" jump is not patched

EXTRA MVP
	Optimisations
		Instead of passing results via memory, pass it via registers (=> return registers used)
		Distribute registers to avoid using the same repeatedly
		Clear symbol table: rm anonym symbols, etc. (cf TODO)
		...
	Functions
	Strings: support for escaped chars ("\n", etc.)
	Ternary operators
	instr_add(): labelise instructions for debugging purposes
