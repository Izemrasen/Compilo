		st_get: instead of using yyerror() each time, put error handling in symtable.c
		free symbols whenever possible
	Find name for compiler
		Ideas: CompOte
	Test "for"
Architecture
	Implement instructions: LOADI, STOREI

BUGS
	#1. If/else: when multiple "if" in "else", "if" jump is not patched

EXTRA MVP
	Optimisations
		Avoid passing results via mem as much as possible
		Instead of passing results via memory, pass it via registers (=> return registers used)
		Distribute registers to avoid using the same repeatedly
		Clear symbol table: rm anonym symbols, etc. (cf TODO)
		...
